Documentation and scripts for book scanning using free software tools.

This poject is organized into the following three main areas:
 * documentation: learn about how to scan books and how to bind those scanned images into a pdf or [djvu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu) file.
 * scripts: useful commands and utility scripts to make working with scanned pages images easier (*not* the main software you need, just some accessories).
 * images: source images for use in testing and as examples of what the tools outlined here can accomplish.

Each area is governed by a different free culture license appropriate to the content. Documentation is under Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0, the scripts are all under CC-0, and the scanned page images are either in the public domain or under one of the Creative Commons licenses. Look for the `LICENSE.txt` file in each directory for details.
