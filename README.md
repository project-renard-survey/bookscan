Documentation and scripts for book scanning using free software tools. 

**Start here**: [Introduction](https://github.com/wikey/bookscan/blob/master/documentation/introduction.md).

This poject is organized into the following two main areas:
 * [documentation](https://github.com/wikey/bookscan/tree/master/documentation): learn about how to scan books and how to bind those scanned images into a pdf or [djvu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu) file.
 * [scripts](https://github.com/wikey/bookscan/tree/master/scripts): useful commands and utility scripts to make working with scanned page images easier (*not* the main software you need, just some accessories).

A sister repository, [bookscan-images](https://github.com/wikey/bookscan-images) contains source images of [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) and freely licensed books for use in testing and as examples of what the tools outlined here can accomplish.
