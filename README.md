# bookscan
Documentation and scripts for book scanning using free software tools.

This poject is organized into the following three main areas:
 * `[documentation](https://github.com/wikey/bookscan/tree/master/documentation)`: learn about how to scan books and how to bind those scanned images into a pdf or [djvu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu) file.
 * `[scripts](https://github.com/wikey/bookscan/tree/master/scripts)`: useful commands and utility scripts to make working with scanned page images easier (*not* the main software you need, just some accessories).
 * `[images](https://github.com/wikey/bookscan/tree/master/images)`: source images for use in testing and as examples of what the tools outlined here can accomplish.

Each area is governed by a different free culture license appropriate to the content. Documentation is under Creative Commons [BY-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode), the scripts are all under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode), and the scanned page images are either in the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) or under one of the allowed Creative Commons licenses. Look for the `LICENSE.txt` file in each directory for details.
