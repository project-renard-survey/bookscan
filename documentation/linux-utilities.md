### Linux utilities

In addition to the direct book scanning and authoring tools, there are a handful of general linux utilities that make working with image and pdf files much easier. These include: 

   a) pdftk
   b) ImageMagick
   c) 7zip

All of these tools are command line ones that are particularly useful for scripts and other kinds of bulk processing. Take a look at the files for each tool for details. 

##### What is the command line?

The command line is a text based interface to your computer that let's you interact with and control your computer by typing rather than clicking your mouse? By allowing you to control your computer with text the command line makes many powerful operations easy. You can save complex commands and reuse them later on, you can connect multiple programs together, and you can run the same command on multiple files in a row. The `scripts` folder has examples of all three of those uses.
